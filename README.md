# F-Script extensions

This project provides two useful extensions for the Mac OS X programming language [F-Script](http://fscript.org/):

1. A command-line program, fscript, that will run F-Script files, and also has an interactive interpreter.
2. A bundle, FSClass, that lets you create new classes in native F-Script, and add methods to existing classes.
